        <div class="game-guide">
          To conquer the maze and claim victory, you must abide by a few crucial
          rules. First and foremost, stay within the confines of the maze's
          walls. Venturing beyond them will lead to disqualification. Use the
          arrow keys or on-screen controls to maneuver through the labyrinth,
          avoiding dead-ends and hidden traps. Keep an eye out for valuable
          power-ups that can aid your progress or provide precious hints.
          Remember, time is of the essence; the faster you navigate, the higher
          your chances of securing a spot on the leaderboard. Are you up for the
          challenge? Take a deep breath, steel your nerves, and let the maze
          adventure begin!
